# The National Archives WordPress Theme

This is the old WordPress theme. As of April 2024 it is still being used in the following areas of the site:

 - Education (except the landing page)
 - Help with your research (except the landing page)
 - Information management (except the landing page)
 - /about/news/
 - /about/our-role/
 - a few stray pages and sections - best place to look for confirmation is the `nginx.conf` in [ds-infrastructure-website](https://github.com/nationalarchives/ds-infrastructure-website/) _(search for location rules that use `$ups_wp`_

There is some additional documentation for some of the quirks on this theme.
