          <p>The location of Cyprus at the eastern end of the Mediterranean meant that it was strategically and diplomatically important within the campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. The island saw no military action but was at the centre of diplomatic efforts to bring Greece into the conflict. Cyprus was also an important base for intelligence and counter-intelligence operations.</p>

            <p>Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-8 Britain and the Ottoman Empire signed a defensive alliance that included an agreement that the Ottoman Sultan ‘consents to assign the Island of Cyprus to be occupied and administered by England’. (<a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/" target="_blank">FO 93/110/27B</a>) Despite this the island remained officially part of the Ottoman Empire. In November 1914 the Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of the Central Powers and on the 5th Cyprus was formally annexed as a British imperial possession. Under the terms of the annexation all Ottoman subjects born in Cyprus would automatically become British subjects. Those born outside Cyprus were given one year to leave the island if they wished to remain Ottoman subjects. (<a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/" target="_blank">CO 70/9</a>)
            <p> Prior to the outbreak of war the British government had discussed the possibility of handing Cyprus over to Greece in return for a naval base at Argostoli on the island of Cephalonia. This was eventually rejected for political reasons.  In early 1915 the Allies were planning a naval campaign against the Ottoman Empire through the Dardanelles.  The Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, was keen to bring Greece into the war on the Allied side and suggested that Britain offer to hand over Cyprus in return for Greek support against the Ottomans. (<a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/" target="_blank">FO 800/91</a>, <a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/" target="_blank">FO 371/2241</a>) The British Cabinet did not agree to the proposal on the grounds that Cyprus might prove strategically useful. (<a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/" target="_blank">CAB 37/123/33</a>)  By the autumn of 1915 the Allied situation in the Eastern Mediterranean had deteriorated with the operations in Gallipoli having reached a stalemate. In October Bulgaria joined the war on the side of the Central Powers launching an invasion of Serbia. The British Government renewed efforts to get Greece to enter the war on the Allied side. On 16th October Grey wrote to the British Ambassador in Athens instructing him to offer to cede Cyprus to Greece in return for her giving ‘immediate and full support with her army to Serbia.' The Greek Government rejected the British offer declaring that it would be 'courting disaster to go to help Serbia’. (<a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/" target="_blank">FO 371/2273</a>) At the end of the war the possibility of ceding the island to Greece was raised once again, but was rejected for strategic reasons. </p>

            <p>In 1917 the Allies considered mounting a joint amphibious operation targeting Ottoman supply lines in Syria. General Foch proposed using Cyprus as a forward base, which met with opposition from the British who argued that the island did not have suitable harbour facilities. The operation never went beyond the planning phase.  (<a href="http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/Details?uri=C2515022" target="_blank">WO 106/723</a>).</p>

          <h2>Intelligence</h2>
          <div class="content-scroll scroll">
            <p>The location of Cyprus, close to Ottoman Syria, and its mixed Greek/Turkish population meant Cyprus was a focus of both intelligence gathering and counter-intelligence operations. Interest in the island started in 1916 after it was placed under the control of Eastern Mediterranean Special Intelligence Bureau (EMSIB) based in Alexandria. The initial concern focused on the large population of Turks who had been Ottoman subjects up until the outbreak of war, and the EMSIB declared that the counter espionage situation was ‘unsatisfactory’. During the course of 1917 the British became convinced that the island was being used as a staging post to send intelligence back to the Ottoman mainland. There were also concerns that local Turks were establishing supply depots on the island’s remote coasts which were helping sustain the German U-boats operating in the area. 
              The EMSIB sent a number of officers to the island to investigate the suspected espionage; however their efforts were hampered by the resistance of the civil authorities. It appears that the High Commissioner Sir John Clauson, was concerned about the impact of arresting individuals for espionage on the tense relations between the various communities on the island.</p>
            <p> In addition to the counter-intelligence work on the island, Cyprus was also used as a base from which British and French agents were sent into Ottoman held territory and as a means through which their information was sent back to Alexandria.
